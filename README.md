# Reinforcement Learning Projects 

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects and implementations developed as part of Reinforcement Learning (RL) course at NPUA.
The projects focus on applying RL algorithms to solve classic problems, such as training agents to play games or optimizing decision-making in simulated environments.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into subdirectories, 
each containing a distinct RL project inspired by 
concepts from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

## Projects 

### [Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe](tic-tac-toe/)
- **Description**: Train an RL agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe, with features like early tie detection and human-play mode.
- **Main File**: [tic_tac_toe.py](tic-tac-toe/src/tic_tac_toe.py)

### [Project 2: Ten-armed-testbed](ten-armed-testbed/)
- **Description**: Train an RL agent (`Bandit`) to select the best action. Demonstrate multiple action selection strategies. Maximize the expected reward by selecting the best actions based on learned estimates.
- **Main File**: [ten-armed-testbed.ipynb](ten-armed-testbed/notebooks/ten_armed_testbed.ipynb)



# Get Started
## Clone the repository 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/ZhasminHovhannisyan/Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd Reinforcement-Learning
```
Make sure dependencies are installed.
More detailed information about each project can be found in corresponding directories.
Then run the main script for each project.
